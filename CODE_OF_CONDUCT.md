To report an offender, please post in the admin group chat with a description of the issue and name of the offender, with screenshots and a URL provided as additional evidence. 

If you would like to privately report an offender, please post on the main admin chat first to report an issue, and an admin will privately get in touch with you.

## Actions Taken
First minor offenses will result in a warning. Repeated offenses can result in a temporary or permanent ban from this community. 
We reserve the right to ban an individual or group at any time and for any reason, even after a single offense.
